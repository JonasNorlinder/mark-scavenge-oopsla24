## Notes on building

The binaries used in the paper was built with the following configuration
`bash configure --with-boot-jdk=/home/user/jdk-21 --with-native-debug-symbols=internal --disable-warnings-as-errors --with-extra-cxxflags=-std=gnu++17`. Note that only Linux/x64 has been tested, so your milage may vary on other platforms.

JDK 21 (for boot image) can be downloaded from [https://jdk.java.net/archive/](https://jdk.java.net/archive/).

## Notes on running

To run MS-ZGC, build the source from branch `mark-scavenge` and use `-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational`.

Other GCs that is not MS-ZGC should be run using a build from the branch `jdk`. In the paper we have only evaluated ZGC generational (default mode is non-generational ZGC). To run generational ZGC use `-XX:+UseZGC -XX:+ZGenerational`.
